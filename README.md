# Rush-Hour

This exercise is inspired by the eponymous sliding block game:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Hour_(puzzle)

Here is the description of the exercise:
1) There is an n x n grid
2) A set of 2 x 1 cars are positioned on the grid. They are oriented horizontally or vertically.
   - Each car can move forward or backward in the direction of the car if another car is not blocking the car.
   - A move is shifting any one car by a single block
3) A special red car, which moves horizontally.
   - The goal is to get the red car to the rightmost end of its lane within a given number of moves (referred to as "limit")
4) There are some 1 x 1 mines on the grid. A car cannot drive over a mine.
5) Cars cannot collide with each other
